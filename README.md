# 2048
A version of the popular game, now with best time tracking. Based on Gabriele Cirulli's [codebase](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

[Enjoy it here!](http://perigk.github.io/Timed-2048/)

## How to play:
There are two modes for the game. The plain game and the timed game.

- Plain game: Click the "New Game" button, on the top right of the board. Move the tiles with the keyboard arrows in order to merge the same tiles. The target is to keep merging, till you create one with the number 2048.
- Timed game: Click the "Timed Game" button, on the top right of the board. It has the same rules as the plain game with the only difference, that you can keep track of your best time. Keep in mind that the best time is only recorded, if you win the game. There is no point in bragging for your record, if you lost. :blush:
